Several examples of analysis that demonstrate different use cases

* complexity: Demonstrate difference between cyclomatic and cognitive complexity

* coverage-metrics: Demonstrate the calculations for line, condition and overall coverage

* size-metrics: Demonstrate the calculation of different size metrics (lines, loc, lines to cover, comment lines and comments %)

* metrics-without-scm: Demonstrate the SonarQube 7.1+ ability to compute metrics on new code even without SCM
