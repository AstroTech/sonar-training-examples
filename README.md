# SonarQube Training Examples

Several examples of analysis that demonstrate different use cases

## Sub-directories

* [complexity](complexity/): Demonstrates difference between cyclomatic and cognitive complexity

* [coverage-metrics](coverage-metrics/): Demonstrates the calculations for line, condition and overall coverage

* [size-metrics](size-metrics/): Demonstrates the calculation of different size metrics (lines, loc, lines to cover, comment lines and comments %)

* [metrics-without-scm](metrics-without-scm/): Demonstrates the SonarQube 7.1+ ability to compute metrics on new code even without SCM

* [branches](branches/): Demonstrates the SonarQube 6.7+ new branch management system, and to compare results with 5.6- old branch management.

* [file-renaming](file-renaming/): Demonstrate the SonarQube 6.7+ issue tracking preservation (and new code preservation) in case of file renaming or file move.
