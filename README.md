# SonarQube Training Examples

Several examples of analysis that demonstrate different use cases

* [complexity](complexity/README.md): Demonstrate difference between cyclomatic and cognitive 

* [coverage-metrics](coverage-metrics/): Demonstrate the calculations for line, condition and overall coverage

* [size-metrics](size-metrics/): Demonstrate the calculation of different size metrics (lines, loc, lines to cover, comment lines and comments %)

* [metrics-without-scm](metrics-without-scm/): Demonstrate the SonarQube 7.1+ ability to compute metrics on new code even without SCM
